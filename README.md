# belly-button-challenge

- DESCRIPTION
  
This challenge uses JavaScript and Plotly to build a dynamic, interactive dashboard to access and visualize data from the Belly Button Biodiversity experiment.

It uses a drop down menu to select an id corresponding to a test subject, goes on to display a bar chart with the top ten bacterial samples found, the individualâ€™s demographic information in another table, a bubble chart that displays each of the sample and a gauge meter that denotes the number of times the individual washes their belly button in a week.



- OBJECTIVE


The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels.


The dashboard includes:

- bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)

- gauge of the frequency of belly button washes weekly for each individual
